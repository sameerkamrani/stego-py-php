## WavSteg
WavSteg uses least significant bit steganography to hide a file in the samples
of a .wav file.

For each sample in the audio file, we overwrite the least significant bits with
the data from our file.

### How to use
WavSteg requires Python 3

Run WavSteg with the following command line arguments:

    -h, --hide        To hide data in a sound file
    -r, --recover     To recover data from a sound file
    -s, --sound=      Path to a .wav file
    -f, --file=       Path to a file to hide in the sound file
    -o, --output=     Path to an output file
    -n, --LSBs=       How many LSBs to use
    -b, --bytes=      How many bytes to recover from the sound file
    --help            Display this message
	
Example:

    WavSteg.py -h -s sound.wav -f file.txt -o sound_steg.wav -n 1
	# OR
	WavSteg.py -r -s sound_steg.wav -o output.txt -n 1 -b 1000
	
### Hiding Data
Hiding data requires the arguments -h, -s, -f, -o, and -n.

The following command would hide the contents of file.txt into sound.wav and
save the result as sound_steg.wav. The command also outputs how many bytes have
been used out of a theoretical maximum. In practice, the maximum amount of data
we can hide may be slightly lower than what is displayed because we skip
samples that have the smallest possible value (for most files, this never
occurs).

Example:

    $ WavSteg.py -h -s sound.wav -f file.txt -o sound_steg.wav -n 1
	Using 1000 B out of 2000 B
	
If you attempt to hide too much data, WavSteg will raise a ValueError and
print the minimum number of LSBs required to hide your data.

### Recovering Data
Recovering data requires the arguments -r, -s, -o, -n, and -b

The following command would recover the hidden data from sound_steg.wav and
save it as output.txt. This requires the size in bytes of the hidden data to
be accurate or the result may be too short or contain extraneous data.

Example:

    $ WavSteg.py -r -s sound_steg.wav -o output.txt -n 1 -b 1000

## LSBSteg
LSBSteg uses least significant bit steganography to hide a file in the color
information of an RGB image (.bmp or .png).

For each color channel (R,G,B) in each pixel of the image, we overwrite the
least significant bits of the color value with the data from our file.
In order to make recovering this data easier, we also hide the filesize
of our input file in the first few color channels of the image.

### How to use
You need Python 3 and Pillow, a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

Run LSBSteg in interactive mode using one of the following commands:
    
	py -i LSBSteg.py
	# OR
	python -i LSBSteg.py

Set the following variables, depending on what you want to do.

    # Path of the image to hide data in
	# Default is "input_image.png"
	input_image_path = "directory\input_image.png"
	
	# Path of the image to recover data from OR
	# Path to write steganographed image
	# Default is "steg_image.png"
	steg_image_path = "directory\steg_image.png"
	
	# Path of file to hide in image
	# Default is "input.zip"
	input_file_path = "directory\input_file.zip"
	
	# Path of file to recover data to
	# Default is "output.zip"
	output_file_path = "directory\output_file.zip"
	
	# Number of least signifcant bits to use when hiding or recovering data
	# Default is 2
	num_lsb = 2
	
	# How much to compress image when saving as .png
	# 1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression
	# Default is 1
	compression = 1

### Analyzing
Before hiding data in an image, it can useful to see how much data can be hidden.
Using num_lsb, input_image_path, and input_file_path, the command analysis() will
produce output similar to the following:

    >>> analysis()
    Image resolution: ( 2000 , 1100 )
    Using 2 LSBs, we can hide:       1650000 B
    Size of input file:              1566763 B
    Filesize tag:                    3 B
	
### Hiding Data
Using num_lsb, input_image_path, input_file_path, steg_image_path, and compression,
we hide data in the input image and write the result to the steganographed image.
The command hide_data() will produce output similar to the following:

    >>> hide_data()
    Hiding 1566763 bytes
    Runtime: 6.11 s

### Recovering Data
Using num_lsb, steg_image_path, and output_file_path we recover data from the
steganographed image and write the result to the output file. The command
recover_data() will produce output similar to the following:

    >>> recover_data()
    Looking to recover 1566763 bytes
    Runtime: 4.44 s

## StegDetect
StegDetect provides one method for detecting simple steganography in images.

### How to Use
You need Python 3 and Pillow, a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

Run StegDetect in interactive mode using one of the following commands:
    
	py -i StegDetect.py
	# OR
	python -i StegDetect.py
	
Set the image path.

    # Path of the image
	# Default is "image_path.png"
	image_path = "directory\image.png"
	
### Showing the Least Significant Bits of an Image
Using image_path, we sum the least significant n bits of the RGB color channels
for each pixel and normalize the result to the range 0-255. This value is then
applied to each color channel for the pixel. Where n is the number of least
significant bits to show, the command show_LSB(n) will save the resulting
image, appending "_nLSBs" to the file name, and will produce output similar to
the following:

    >>> show_LSB(1)
    Runtime: 3.55 s
